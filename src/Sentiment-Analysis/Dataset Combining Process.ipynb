I truly enjoy the images that you have shared and I wish to see your work published.  That the final result may differ from what was envisioned at the start of the journey does not lesson the value.  I want to see things created and to nurture creativity and that is what I see happening.   Please know that I respect and believe that choices you make will be the right ones.

       "4      Glad to see this campaign come to fruition. I pledged for the HC. I would have jumped up to the signed bookplate HC but that was quite a big step up.

       "25371  I am very happy to read your update tonight!   This is wonderful news and I remain pleased and excited to support this journey.   You asked about concerns over page counts and bindings and sizes and I just want to state that none of that matters to me.   Nor does the timing,  I did not back this project for a 'product'.  I truly enjoy the images that you have shared and I wish to see your work published.  That the final result may differ from what was envisioned at the start of the journey does not lesson the value.  I want to see things created and to nurture creativity and that is what I see happening.   Please know that I respect and believe that choices you make will be the right ones.  I will have no complaint when we reach this journey's end and I will celebrate.   Journey on with courage and cheer.    \n",
