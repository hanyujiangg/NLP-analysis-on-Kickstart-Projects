An heart filled project dedicated to my best friend who was murdered during my 8 years in prison."
Â¡Hola! I am ready to record my second album. Your support will make this a reality :)
rarumpumpum.com - please go and listen to some fine Gospel
We have nearly completed production of our debut album. We want to get it into your hands, heads and hearts as quickly as possible!
This project is to fund the final stages of Stephen & Zooey's record California; specifically the mastering, printing and distribution.
Somos G-90 grupoâ€‹ integrado por 4 jovenes talentosos en busca de poder compartir nuestra musicaâ€‹ con el mundo entero.
The Trio is going into the studio. This album is a collaboration of all original songs... breakbeat, hard-bop, ballads, and fun!
You know what they always say, "Light & Ladder is touring the Midwest & releasing their first full-length 'This Is Not Your Pen'"
In the past I have supported the arts of several other musicians and now am excited to have begun working on my first solo project!
We're a Rock n' Roll band taking off for our first tour and recording our first full length.
