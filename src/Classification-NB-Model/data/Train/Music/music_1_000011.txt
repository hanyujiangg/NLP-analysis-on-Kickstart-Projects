John Ludy Puleo of Ludy Tunes fame is reaching out to fellow kick starters to help raise funding for a studio recording project.
Throughout his semester in Nashville, Dave's goal is to record an album with acoustic and full-band arrangements of original songs.
We are raising funds for our first music video. We are a very theatrical band with large ideas! Help make our video happen!
Music to blow the mind
Help Maniac Minds build a Recording Studio in BARRIE, ON
We propose a first in the music industry.
We may not be able to press vinyl, but we are still releasing this new music. There is no substitute for physical media and artwork.
All we want to do is make good music for people to listen to. We can dream, can't we?
When it's Christmas Night in Sactown, all the jazzbirds will be swinging. That is, if you support our holiday jazz album.
Bringin' our live show to the U.S.A. with stops in Indianapolis, Atlanta and New York!!
