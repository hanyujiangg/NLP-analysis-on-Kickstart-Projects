Thank You!"
We are musicians born and raised in NYC, who are working from the very bottom to create a psychedelic-jazz fusion, rock and metal scene
My dream is to record this album entitled 'False Idols'. My goal is to influence and inspire people, to achieve there dreams!
We've been in the studio recording our debut album and we just need your help to release it!
This record has songs that deal with being resilient, songs of overcoming loss, and songs adapting to change through praise.
squint is releasing our next record. We are doing this with YOU. No record deal...just squint and some friends, making an album.
If you make this jazz & blues singer's dream of a studio CD come true, I faithfully promise to make you proud with a high-quality CD!
Earthy, funky grooves, horn textures made of golden syrup and a whole lot of fun!
Bring the #CallingOnYou album to life so it can give strength & hope, serving as a voice against discrimination.
Help us put our first album, Chipsurf Pipeline, onto a 7" single or 12" LP!
